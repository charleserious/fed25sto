        <section id="1">
          <h3>Plastics</h3>
          <p>
            All standard LEGO and DUPLO elements and some of the baseplates are
            manufactured from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), which is
            the plastic material used in the largest quantities. The most
            obvious benefits derived from using this material are the bright,
            shiny colours that can be achieved, as well as the ability to
            maintain its shape and its resistance to scratching. ABS is also
            resistant to perspiration, saliva and other substances with which
            LEGO elements often come into contact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our buckets and some of the other storage packagings and containers
            are manufactured from PolyPropylene (PP).
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary material used in the manufacture of transparent elements
            is PolyCarbonate (PC) which is, however, not particularly resistant
            to fatty substances. The use of small quantities of colorant results
            in attractive elements. PC is also used for elements which require
            strength and rigidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes other characteristics are required and other materials are
            used. The reasons for using other materials include a need for
            extreme mechanical strength or sliding characteristics, abrasion
            resistance, elasticity, durability and hardness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, a large proportion of the plastics, which are generally
            available, are used in the manufacture of the LEGO product range.
          </p>

          <p>
            The moulds used in LEGO Group factories are so designed that waste
            is minimal. However, we may discover a quality problem in a batch of
            manufactured elements. In such cases, we scrap the elements
            concerned and sort them. When the colour is changed in the moulding
            machines, this also leads to the rejection of a number of elements.
            Most of these rejected elements are returned to the manufacturing
            process. In fact, less than 1% cannot be reused in this way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before reusing re-ground materials, we check to ensure that their
            purity is at the same high level as that of new materials. If it is
            not, the material is rejected and sold for other purposes.

          <h3>Semi-manufactured goods</h3>
          <p>
            Not everything in the LEGO product range is produced by us - some
            parts are semi-manufactured goods purchased from suppliers all over
            the world. For example, we buy motors, transformers, metal
            components, electronic components, semi-manufactured plastics and
            rubber components and magnets. Our external suppliers work in
            accordance with the same environmental and quality requirements as
            the LEGO Group's own factories.

          <h3>Packaging</h3>
          <p>
            LEGO packaging is designed to protect the contents and to present
            our products in an attractive way. The packaging must also provide
            the consumer with optimal information on the set's contents - around
            60% of sales to consumers are in self-service retail outlets.
            Lastly, packaging is designed so that packing at the factories can
            be efficient.

          <h3>Plastics in packaging</h3>
          <p>
            The plastics, that the LEGO Group currently uses for its packaging,
            have been selected because, among those available with today's
            technology, they are least disruptive to the environment. They are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              PET (PolyEthylenTerephthalate) - also known as PETE - and SB
              (StyreneButadiene) for vacuum-formed packaging components.
            </li>
            <li>PP (PolyPropolene) as film for outer wrappings and bags.</li>
            <li>PET as window film.</li>
            <li>PE (PolyEthylene) as shrink-wrap film.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The quantity of plastics used in LEGO packaging is declining, both
            in terms of the number of plastic components and in total weight.
            One of the reasons for the low weight is that, when we changed over
            from PVC (PolyVinylChloriede) to PET in 1990, we were able to reduce
            the material thickness by some 30% for vacuum-formed packaging
            components and by between 25% and 30% for window film.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plastics we use today are, in principle, suitable for recycling,
            provided that the problems associated with collection and sorting
            are solved. Collection and sorting systems are currently being
            established in most European countries.

          <h3>Printed materials</h3>
          <p>
            We do not yet use recycled paper for our brochures. This is because
            paper manufacturers have still been unable to develop qualities
            which fulfil our requirements for a uniform, truthful and attractive
            representation of our products in the various brochures and building
            instructions.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, we are following developments closely and are ready to use
            recycled paper as soon as it lives up to our quality requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            We require the printers, who supply printed materials, building
            instructions and packaging to the LEGO Group, to use printing inks
            with the following properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>non-toxic</li>
            <li>resistant to saliva and perspiration</li>
            <li>non-soluble and smudge-free</li>
            <li>in compliance with health authority requirements</li>
