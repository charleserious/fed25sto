      during the second world war.

      Just after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered an address to
      the Canadian parliament on Friday, lawmakers gave 98-year-old Yaroslav
      Hunka a standing ovation when speaker Anthony Rota drew attention to him.
      Rota introduced Hunka as a war hero who fought for the First Ukrainian
      Division.

      “In my remarks following the address of the president of Ukraine, I
      recognised an individual in the gallery. I have subsequently become aware
      of more information which causes me to regret my decision to do so,” Rota
      said in a statement.
