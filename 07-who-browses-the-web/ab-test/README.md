# A/B Testing

This project demonstrate my understanding of how to set up experiments and analyze results.

## What it contains

1. 1 static section
2. 1 dynamic section (your A/B test)
3. 1 CTA with tracking
   1. This doesnâ€™t posted anywhere, it's only a `console.log` to the console with the proper naming convention and payload.
   2. Keep GDPR in mind.

## How to run this project

1. Clone this repo (obviously)
2. `cd ab-test`
3. `npm install` or `pnpm install` which is my favorite
4. `npm run dev` or `pnpm run dev`
